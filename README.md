# Electrocardiogram

As part of a team of 2, created an electrocardiogram display by picking up very small voltage differences in 3 extremities, amplifying them, filtering them, converting them to a digital value that an EasyAVR board (a development board based on the ATMEGA16A microcontroller) could understand, and serializing and sending through USB to a laptop with a Processing program displaying the variation of voltage in the heart and calculating and displaying the beats per minute.
